# GPU_test_pytorch
train picture classification model to compare the performance between cpu and gpu.
## Test CPU performance
run picture classfication model with cpu, store the result at result_cpu.txt.<br>
- python codes/cpu_test.py

## Test GPU performance
run picture classfication model with gpu, store the result at result_gpu.txt.<br>
- python codes/gpu_test.py
